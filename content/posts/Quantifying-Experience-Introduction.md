## Introduction

This essay is part self-exploration and part detached observation. I have been actively seeking full-time opportunities in the world that can give me a bit of financial freedom, and doing so has forced me to engage with some self-honesty.

This whole process has been unexpectedly difficult. To be totally honest, I kind of naively expected that with my education history, I would be able to land an entry level role rather quickly, but this was a pretty flawed assumption.

I had forgotten two things:
1. Thousands of people graduate from Ivy League colleges every year
2. Thousands of people are so damn cool that they make amazing things without even finishing college

And the truth is, I don’t really hang well with these people on paper. Makes sense. I spent my summers driving around the US, writing, reading books on topics that have nothing to do with math or computer science, and trying to have interesting experiences that open my mind up in new ways. I spent some time in Alaska, Montana, Rhode Island, northern Michigan, a few nights in Georgia, a couple weeks in California, worked at a liquor store, built trucks in Detroit factories, and quit a job as a software development intern at a failing startup. Many of my competitors for these roles spent their summers getting internships and building stuff.

_**This has been putting me at a clear disadvantage in the job market.**_

I began to ask myself why this is the case, and what specifically distinguishes these qualified applicants from myself. From this line of inquiry, I opened the door to a new formulation of the question:

> **What is my value proposition to society?**  

And to that I had (have) no answer, truthfully.

The remainder of the essay will exist in two parts. Part 1 will involve a bit of self-exploration that might elucidate why I made the choices I did and what I have learned overall. Part 2 will broaden the notion of value to explore some ideas about how we quantify value in society and what this means for individual freedoms.

Let’s doooo it.

## Part 1 - Liquor Stores and Automotive Factories

Apologies if you don’t care to read this part. Skip to part 2. However, I think taking a look at oneself and acknowledging one’s past experiences is a valuable first step in turning attention towards the outside world at-large.

Anyway, if you’re sticking around, thanks.

I made the decisions that I made for the last few years because I want to be a dynamic person. I want to be multi-dimensional and comfortable throwing myself into new situations. With the fall, winter, and spring being consumed by math and computer science, I sought to use the summers as time to work on music, to write, to explore philosophy and art, and connect with people in new situations that I felt weren’t getting enough attention in the rapid world of technology and mass culture.

That has always been a motivating factor for me. I find things that I think people undervalue and I learn everything I can about them, eventually consolidating my experience into a medium of communication. Sometimes it is writing, sometimes it is just conversation. To this day, the most fulfilling experience I have had was working at that factory in metro Detroit. I had to be up at 5:30AM every day, make food for the day, drive 35 minutes to the factory, and do physical labor building cars until about 4:00pm when I would come home exhausted but mentally lucid. I’d workout and then spend the evenings enjoying the company of my girlfriend/friends in the area. It was incredibly difficult but so deeply fulfilling. I came back to Brown in the fall with a fresh perspective, a ready mind, and so much new experience to draw on that would inform my decisions for the next 8 months.

In that factory, most of the people I worked with had a criminal record. I guess it was because the company could hire felons for less money than someone without a record, and for that reason I got to meet people with backgrounds so vastly different than my own privileged upbringing that it was almost unfathomable that we were inhabiting the same universe. These people worked 10 hours of hard labor every single day. They complained, they took breaks when they could get them, but they showed up every single day and did what they had to do. It was remarkable. They worked so hard. I was the one who needed be taught, and their patience with me was astounding. Teaching someone how to use rivet guns and weld who spent the years coding neural networks and analyzing partial differential equations must have been a mess for them, but they did it and it was incredible.

My point with this anecdote is that experiences like this are what really drive me. Anytime I get the opportunity to do something similar, I agree with no questions asked. I was making terrible money and depriving myself of sleep, but I would do it today. In fact, my first thought upon graduating was “What is something similar that I can do?”

So I applied to work as a cashier at a liquor store. This specific store didn’t get much business so I spent the time stocking shelves, handling deliveries, and writing. My boss was a Bulgarian man named Cho, who became one of my most trusted friends that summer. By the end of my time there, I was working out with him, visiting the store in my off-hours just to talk, and taking shifts whenever I could grab them.

I got more out of these two experiences than any class I took at Brown.

And they aren’t even that crazy. That’s kinda the point. This leads me into the next section.

## Part 2 - Looking Outward

We place such a large emphasis on the massive achievements of individuals that we often fail to look at the banal. We laude the Nobel Prize winners, or people that became millionaires before they could legally buy a drink in the United States, and we are often right to do so. However, so much of our world runs on the backs of people that just show up and do the small things to keep the wheels turning.

Experiences like the ones I briefly discussed above are the most valuable ones I have. But how can I quantify that? How can I convince an employer that I can add value to their company because I built cars with my hands, when they need someone who can code smart contracts on Ethereum? The experiences above have been so incredibly vital in my ability to connect with new people and learn new skills, but it didn’t give me a lot of quantifiable value that I can add to an economy. I am a better friend because of these experiences, I am a better son, significant other, and overall person, but I am not a more attractive job candidate.

A problem of mine seems to be that my value proposition and what I have gained from these experiences is hard to quantify. You can’t put a number on “maturity” or “size of perspective”. You can’t build your personal brand around stocking shelves at a liquor store in Rhode Island. Well, maybe some marketing genius can but that’s not me.

However, you _can_ easily quantify what you gained by working for Google during the summer: “I spent 3 months building a feature on Google Docs using these two languages in a team with this amount of people and here is my work.” It is clear what experience you have, and it is clear what your skills are. It makes it really easy for somebody to put you in a box and say “Hey, they are a software developer. We need one of those. Let’s hire them.” Obviously, there are extraneous variables that must be considered, and having the right quantifiable experience is only one part of the hiring process, but it so often seems that it trumps the other aspects involved without a fair game.

Now, before I push this exploration further, I feel compelled to make a somewhat obvious disclaimer:

> DISCLAIMER: I recognize that I do not have a PhD in economics. I recognize that I probably don’t understand enough about the world to be making declarations about its problems. I recognize that I am 22 and likely embody somewhat of a utopian perspective about the potential for an organism like society to take shape.   

So read all of what follows with that in mind.

What I would like to posit is that a fundamental problem in our culture seems to be that we don’t know how to assess peoples’ potential value in an economy. We know how to assess their skills, and we use some fallible predicative modeling to project how valuable of an asset they will be in a particular workforce, but these projections are often wrong. Job interviews are notoriously bad at predicting who will be successful and who won’t be in a company, and I have a hunch that it’s because of the intangible qualities about people that add more than can be measured in a coding interview.

It makes sense to use quantifiable metrics to vet people’s potential to add value to an organization. We trust things that we can tangibly see, hold, and understand. I don’t believe this should be changed at all. The problem is that quantifiable metrics are limited in their scope, currently.  A result of this problem is that our economies and markets are run by numbers. Again, this makes sense. Numbers are easier to understand. It’s easy to see that $10,000 is less than $100,000 dollars. It’s easy to see that 5 years is more than 3 years. We know what $100,000 dollars will do in our pockets, but we aren’t as sure what “good communication skills” will do. We know that the latter is generally a good thing, but we don’t know its real power.

This issue shows itself most clearly in the world of art. There are countless musicians on Spotify with millions of monthly listeners. If we translated that into startup parlance, we might say that they have millions of active monthly users. That would be an incredible feat, and any startup with those numbers would be thrilled. However, many of these musicians barely make enough money to live on their own. I personally know a few of them.

Why?

Because we don’t know how to value the experience we gain from listening to music.

What would you rather have be deleted from the universe? Twitter, or your top 5 favorite musicians?

I’m deleting Twitter without a thought, and I suspect many would do the same.

## Conclusion

There is so much more to be said on this topic, and I will be exploring it more in the next few essays: “Quantifying Experience Pt.X”. I will attempt to look at situations where understanding things numerically is inherently difficult, and seeing if I can find ways to do it. These next few essays will be a deeper dive into value, how we determine it, how new technology might change this, and what I think we can do to uplift everyone into the new global economy by leaning into the things that they are naturally good at.

I have always felt that these things were a major flaw in how we operate as a society. Social convention is always changing, so becoming successful is really a matter of “How lucky are you? How well do you currently match the needs of our society right now?”

This leaves many feeling confused and worthless. If you don’t have a good natural proclivity to code, your path to financial success in the world is maimed. However, in a couple decades when computers code themselves, who will be lucky then?

In short, this essay serves as a simple introduction into a problem that captivates me.

Put plainly, what I will be exploring in the next few essays is: How can we quantify intangible value? How will blockchain change this? How can we empower individuals to find niches in society that value them like they deserve? How can we remove the ceiling for one to have an impact in society?

If you made it this far, and you have thoughts or want to add something, DM me on twitter or send me an email. Both should be on this website somewhere if you just play around.
