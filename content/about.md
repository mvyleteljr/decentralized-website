I never know what to write on these “About me” pages. It’s weird.

The basics:
1. EDUCATION: Brown University ’20 Applied Mathematics and Computer Science
2. HOMETOWN: Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan
3. CURRENT RESIDENCE: Boulder, Colorado
4. CURRENT OCCUPATION: Part-Time Contractor work as Software Engineer for Rocket Alumni Solutions (Friend of a friend’s startup)

Aside from that, I make music. Not recently, because I’m broke and have turned my attention to finding a full-time job. This website is part of my attempt to be more interesting. Is it working?

Anywho, I think about a lot of things. Hopefully I don’t have to describe what I think about because it will be posted here.

Idk.

Honestly.

Just enjoy this site. If you wanna learn “About me” then contact me through Twitter or email.

Otherwise, just play around. I’m not gonna be able to adequately summarize myself in words here. I’m also too lazy to try.
