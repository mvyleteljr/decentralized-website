Introduction This essay is part self-exploration and part detached observation. I have been actively seeking full-time opportunities in the world that can give me a bit of financial freedom, and doing so has forced me to engage with some self-honesty.
This whole process has been unexpectedly difficult. To be totally honest, I kind of naively expected that with my education history, I would be able to land an entry level role rather quickly, but this was a pretty flawed assumption.</description>

Letâ€™s just jump right in.
 Why? I want to be clear about my intentions with diving into this world completely so as not to get caught up in the obvious wealth generating potential. I think that with good work and ideas, the money should naturally take care of itself.
While my knowledge is obviously somewhat limited, I still feel confident enough to posit a few research avenues and general philosophical underpinnings that should sustain my appetite to research and continue finding ways to add value.</description>
