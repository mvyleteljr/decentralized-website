      <description>What? Last year, I spent some time exploring the possibility of a news analysis ecosystem built on-chain.
Here is the exploratory whitepaper detailing the concept:
  Introduction There is an incomprehensible amount of information circulating on the internet. Over 4 billion humans connected to the web are constantly adding to the collection, each with their own implicit and explicit biases shaping how they perceive and propagate the information with which they interact.</description>

      <description>I never know what to write on these “About me” pages. It’s weird.
The basics:
 EDUCATION: Brown University ’20 Applied Mathematics and Computer Science HOMETOWN: Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan CURRENT RESIDENCE: Boulder, Colorado CURRENT OCCUPATION: Part-Time Contractor work as Software Engineer for Rocket Alumni Solutions (Friend of a friend’s startup)  Aside from that, I make music. Not recently, because I’m broke and have turned my attention to finding a full-time job.</description>
