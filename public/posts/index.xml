			<description>The following is an essay I wrote to myself during late summer 2019. Since then, many things have changed, and I would probably re-write this essay with different language, but the overall ideas are still important to me. This piece forces me to take a step back and take the mental position of myself during the time of writing, and I always find a bit of peace in doing so. I think it is a valuable thing to re-read from time to time, so I&amp;rsquo;m putting it here in hopes that a piece of this will resonate with whoever visits the site.</description>

<p>#writing+projects/essays/complete</p>
<p>When I reflect back on my summer, I realize is that I simply had the opportunity to understand and live my beliefs. I took time to relax, let the dust settle, saw what remained, and attempted to live my day-to-day life with the lessons learned from watching this process. This is a summary of what I learned.</p>
<p>Before this summer, my life was very much about separation. I always spoke and wrote about dualities that I thought existed between different “parts” of myself. For example, I would often talk about there being “one part of me that just wants to be a creative musician, and spend his whole life creating art” and there being “another part who loves research, math, and science, and the more rational ways of solving problems in the world”. This, I didn’t realize at the time, was actually boosting my sense of identity/ego, and making it more difficult to actually act on any of what I believed, because deep down I was afraid of letting parts of myself die that I seemingly spent my whole life creating.</p>
<p>One important realization along this line of inquiry was when I realized the pervasiveness of my self-absorption. I realized that in all of my dealings with the world, I was stuck trying to think about how I was perceiving, always asking “well, what am I supposed to learn about this?”. Being present was impossible, and I thought that by analyzing my perceptions of my immediate environment that I was being present, but that is simply untrue. There was a mental war that I was raging in myself between all of the dualities that I built. When I broke my wrist, and when things burned up with Hannah, there was a forced death of different parts of my identity. I could no longer play guitar, I couldn’t workout, and I didn’t have my best friend to talk to that could help me figure out how to handle what was in front of me. I felt that I was on extremely unstable ground, and needed to go deep into myself to figure out what I could stand on.</p>
<p>This led to to the first half of the summer. The first half was all about taking things in and putting them in their place. I wrote about what I believed, read books that supplemented and changed these beliefs, and assimilated my new findings with my previous ideology about how I should live in the world. This led me to Thoreau, Marcus Aurelius, Aldous Huxley, books on psychedelics, and others that all provided similar information about what the true nature of reality is, and how one should navigate it. I was still in my cast during this time, so it was a perfect period to just consume information, and write about what I felt about it. There was a lot of mental experimentation during this time, and I essentially spent 100% of my time breaking apart my beliefs in my head, and playing devil’s advocate with everything that entered my consciousness.</p>
<p>Eventually, I found myself on a trip to visit friends in San Francisco, and made another important discovery. My writing was becoming extremely circular, and I realized that I had broke everything down about as far as it could go, and the habit of continuous devil’s advocate was no longer breaking new ground. At this point, I decided it was time to put everything together. I wrote my “manifesto” of everything that I thought I believed from the ground up, and spent the few days after building on that to create a comprehensive picture of reality that I thought could create a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>When I returned from San Francisco, there was an intermediate period of letting the dust settle and turning off my brain that needed to follow, and that perfectly aligned with a week up north with the family having some fun during the 4th of July. I simply relaxed, read some books, and tried to enjoy myself and forget about everything else.</p>
<p>After the conclusion of this intermediate period began the second half of my summer: living my beliefs. This began the day that I left for Montana. From the second I got in the car, I decided, in line with my new ideas on how to live, that I would simply say yes to everything and just be in the moment for the remainder of the trip. That is exactly what happened. I spent the last few weeks relaxing, enjoying myself, learning when I had the opportunity, and experiencing life when I could. The result was that all of my beliefs were modified and strengthened so that I felt even more comfortable with being alive and felt even more connected to the world.</p>
<p>One thing that changed was my perception of these dualities that I thought existed in my life. I realized that none of them matter. One day I could be a musician, the next I could be a mathematician, and I could end the week a philosopher. What I realized though, was that there was a common thread throughout all of what I wanted to be. That thread was discovery. I want to learn, grow, experience, change, develop, fail, try again, and continue to learn. I realized that I didn’t actually care about society’s definition of success. I had mine. That definition really came down to the answer to the questions of “How much love do I have?” and “How present/connected do I feel to this moment, right now?”. Success to me meant the answers were “as much as possible” and “completely” to those questions. Once I realized this, I was liberated. I truly stopped caring about the opinions of others and turned my attention to life. I fell in love with being alive and wanted to learn everything about it, and experience every part. Why? Because it’s incredible. There is a process, that we cannot fathom, that created the trees and the mountains and the rivers and all of the life that inhabits it. We pale in comparison to that incredible mystery, and it is nothing short of total arrogance to care so much about yourself and the opinions of others. You have an opportunity, right now, to be alive and feel connected to everything in front of you. Liberation is possible right now, and you can learn anything.</p>
<p>In short, what I realized is that life is already perfect. Every part of it. The most important thing in the world is right now. The only important thing to do is love life fully and deeply. If you make your decisions out of a desire to love and understand, all will be will. Society and life is so transient that if you put too much stake in things that are constantly shifting, you will never be on stable ground. The only stable ground is the fact that you are aware, right now. Stand on that and let it be enough. You are enough. You can love more deeply, you can experience life more deeply through researching and respecting all natural parts of it. There is no separation between the different parts of yourself. There is just right now.</p>
<p>Moving forward, my only task is to remember this and continue to grow and iterate on top of it. There are a few ways that I think I’ll be able to do that, and here is a brief list of those tactics:</p>
<pre><code>1. Get into nature. Feel small. Let it heal you.
2. Stare your fears directly in the face and do not be ashamed of them. Go directly at them and seek to learn, love, and understand.
3. There are different levels of knowledge. To know something is not simply to be able to discuss it. Reality is not words, it is experience. To know something fully is to experience the knowing.
4. Your life will open up in direct proportion to how you simplify it. Get rid of distracting voices, get rid of what you can that distracts you from right now.
5. You can feel freedom in all parts of your life. You can feel it while brushing your teeth, reading a book, playing video games, or any other part of your life. You don’t have to go live alone with no distractions to do it, but it might help remind you of what’s important from time to time.
6. Nothing substitutes for direct experience. You can think all you want, but thought is simply thought. It means nothing if you cannot live it. Never miss an opportunity to practice what you preach, right now.
7. You are the mountains, you are the trees. The same process that created them created you. Respect yourself as that process. You are worth all of the love that you want to give.
8. If you can accept death, you can accept life. You must accept and embrace death as another beautiful part of life. If you can do this fully, you will have no more fear. There is profound liberation available in profound suffering, and to internalize this is to accept all parts of life.
9. What you must do in your life is simple. Do what allows you to love more. Do what allows you to feel more connected to the present. Build and iterate on this.
10. You don’t need to be healthy and fit to practice love, but it helps. You don’t need shelter to have love, but it helps. You still need to survive to be able to grow on your love and help disseminate it. It’s okay to get a traditional job, and do things that help you stay happy and alive. Just don’t put so much value on these conventions. Your true god is life. Try to create a life that lets you explore and respect life as fully and deeply as possible, but if you don’t have that right now, it’s okay! It’s all good right now and always.
</code></pre>
<p>To conclude. I finally learned <strong><em>why</em></strong> it’s okay and what it actually feels like to relax. It’s okay to surrender. It’s okay to die. It’s okay to not be perfect. It’s okay to not be exactly what everyone wants you to be. You are a perfect piece of life, like the trees are perfect trees and water is perfect water. There is no separation in life. We are simply all trying to create an existence that makes us happy. Until we can experience the knowledge of total presence, we must respect all parts and allow the feelings of separation to persist. The body is real, the mind is real, consciousness is real. All of it is real, but maybe not in the way you think it is. Accept it all and make these beliefs deeper by practicing them and experiencing them more deeply. Invite death in so you can invite life in. Invite everything in. Everything. This is how you liberate yourself. The key is simply profound love and surrender.</p>

Let’s just jump right in.
 Why? I want to be clear about my intentions with diving into this world completely so as not to get caught up in the obvious wealth generating potential. I think that with good work and ideas, the money should naturally take care of itself.
While my knowledge is obviously somewhat limited, I still feel confident enough to posit a few research avenues and general philosophical underpinnings that should sustain my appetite to research and continue finding ways to add value.</description>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I want to be clear about my intentions with diving into this world completely so as not to get caught up in the obvious wealth generating potential. I think that with good work and ideas, the money should naturally take care of itself.</p>
<p>While my knowledge is obviously somewhat limited, I still feel confident enough to posit a few research avenues and general philosophical underpinnings that should sustain my appetite to research and continue finding ways to add value. I will expand on the following for now, but the main “things“ are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Value - How does value get determined in a decentralized system?</li>
<li>Markets - How do people actually get connected to one another to trade services and create novel markets across borders? Again, how does the value of a particular transaction get decided?</li>
<li>“Real World Translation” - How will this translate into life? How can this digital community-based system of decentralized financial (DeFi) tools take the value manifested online and transform it into things that really help people live? (Food, shelter, clothing, safety, general wealth, etc…)</li>
<li>Empowerment - How can this technology provide novel wealth generation opportunities to the individual by leveraging these three components above?</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, my obsession with this technology is in the last question. I want to understand how these decentralized ecosystems can empower anyone to find a community or others to connect with that need what they can uniquely offer. Similarly, I want to understand the flow of value and resources to patch up leaks to ensure an efficient distribution of resources in such a way for people to tap into communal wealth without necessarily having to be a developer on the chain, or be a “builder” themselves. This may be a pipe dream, but it feels like this technology is really a wealth distribution mechanism. With every individual having some semblance of power in a system, everyone is motivated to increase its value.</p>
<p>I want to understand how to create mechanisms that work WITH deep-rooted human behavior (selfishness, desire for power and wealth, status, desire to be a part of something meaningful, desires for connection, etc…) to empower individuals to be able to truly take control of their lives. The future of work is not working.</p>
<p><strong>The possibility exists for every person to work for themselves, do what they love to do, and live a healthy, complete life. All that is missing is the knowledge of how best to distribute resources and value in a way that doesn’t provide a ceiling to the limits of personal wealth, but also allows those with nothing to be valuable players in the global economy.</strong></p>
<p>The truth is, money sits at the root of freedom in society. If you have wealth, you have freedom. While money doesn’t buy you freedom from your personal problems or necessarily translate into happiness, it is the single most important aspect of being alive and healthy these days. I see no way around that. Point is, it is much easier to become a better human if you know where your next meal is coming, where you can sleep, and if you know that if you want to have some experience, you can afford to make it happen.  There really is no reason that everyone shouldn’t have access to these things. There are limits, obviously. We live in a world of scarcity, and not everyone can live in a Beverly Hills mansion. There just isn’t enough space. But honestly, everyone should be able to live safely, where they want to, and know that their basic human needs are going to be met without question. This is possible. Those who want more should be able to make that happen by adding more value, but not everyone wants that.</p>
<p>So to be clear, I want to explore the concept of wealth and value in a decentralized environment to more easily empower individuals to create and find their way to wherever they want to be in the social hierarchy.  This utopian view obviously will require SOME time sacrifices on the part of the individual, but we should be able to find ways to decrease the suffering from that sacrifice. Let’s go deeper.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="value">Value</h2>
<p>The point of this paper is not to solve these questions for myself, but rather to crystallize and clarify the questions themselves. The most important of which is the question of how value is manifested in this system. My understanding is that there are a few ways to understand this. Obviously, we value the things that bring us the experiences we desire: not being hungry, doing meaningful work, experiencing art, having a community, and having fun (amongst others). Now, in the decentralized world, this seems to be dealt with through the concept of legitimacy. If we decide that something is a legitimate manifestation of the thing we want, we value it.</p>
<p>To elucidate this further, we can use the recent example of Elon Musk considering whether to create an NFT of a tweet of his. As Vitalik points out in a recent blog post, if Elon Musk himself does this and sells it, it would be worth millions. But if I do this of the SAME tweet, the value dramatically decreases because it is not as “legitimate” in the eyes of the community. This feels intuitively true, but is really just a manifestation of this human need to capture a somewhat fake “essence” in things. It’s a further abstraction of the idea that if I tell you this baseball was the one hit on Babe Ruth’s first homerun, you will be dramatically engaged with it. It takes on a power. But then if I tell you “No wait, this is actually my kid’s baseball from practice yesterday”, it is worthless even though nothing about the ball has changed. This is a phenomenally human quality that is both beautiful and important, but can cause dramatic issues in an economy. We value things in particularly strange ways, and this contributes to a massive misallocation of resources away from things that matter more strongly, like having a safe home in a good area, or access to healthy food and clean drinking water. That is why we both hate billionaires and want to be them. We see their “obvious” misallocation of wealth towards things like fast cars and incredible homes, but we also recognize that if we had the chance, it’s likely most of us would do the same.</p>
<p>The question becomes: How might it be possible to take advantage of this dichotomy to capture our value systems and distribute resources most effectively? Should we really just rely on those generating the most wealth to be altruistic in their usage of it? I’m not sure that is something we can rely on for many reasons. For one, this has been a possibility for a long time, but we still have millions of homeless people and incredibly impoverished communities. Secondly, how do we determine what is the most effective form of altruism (philosopher William MacAskill has pioneered the term “Effective Altruism” to explore this)? Third, how do we determine the most effective ways to support causes we deem are valuable, assuming our moral compass is well-calibrated?</p>
<p>In short, deciding what is valuable and what is not can be a fickle thing that will likely not provide any novel changes in human culture if we simply digitize and decentralize the current economic system. It gets better, but it isn’t solved.</p>
<p>Lastly, if someone wants to begin providing value, and is willing to offer good X for amount Y, but someone else is willing to offer it for Y-1, then we just see the same type of price gouging that takes advantage of inherently capitalist systems. How does one understand their own value, find, and connect with people who value them equally? Where are the opportunities for personal empowerment in this space?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="markets">Markets</h2>
<p>This section should be shorter. The question is about market efficiency and participation. What I want to understand is how markets are created and operated so someone like me can find ways to participate in them. DeFi liquidity pools are an interesting example of this efficiency, but the barrier to entry, while technologically small, is still large if one wants to be effective in this. I’m not sure something needs to be solved here, just understood deeper so active and effective participation is possible. This is an area where I feel I could personally create value for myself, but I’m not exactly sure how that translates into a broader notion of community value.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="translation">Translation</h2>
<p>Food, shelter, clothing, and community are the most fundamental aspects of well-being. These MUST be satisfied to some extent to make it possible for people to grow. They are the most basic of human needs and are an inextricable part of life. The question is quite simply, assuming one finds a way to create wealth for themselves in the global economy, how will we extend this to cover ways to maintain the basic needs in a similarly free and decentralized way? This is just something I want to explore, not another issue per se.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="empowerment-and-conclusion">Empowerment and Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize, I am interested in personal wealth creation without the need to work for anyone but yourself. I want to find ways to take advantage of this global technology to work with the inherent proclivities of humanity to create markets that more efficiently allocate resources in line with these proclivities that translate into real world gain. Again, how people decide to use their wealth is up to them, but it seems that there is a creative solution that raises the tide to lift all boats. What could this look like?</p>
<p>I am not convinced yet that this new technology will solve the whale problem. It’s an obvious step in the right direction, but what I want to do is make creative markets that increase efficiency to make sure that every bit of our massive circulating resources finds its way to the individual who can find their particular niche in this economy. Right now, there are still so many instances of the biggest whales just getting bigger, and the technological barrier to entry is still massive. If you are not a developer or a skilled financier, how do you engage with this new tech?</p>
<p>Additionally, I haven’t even gone into the consensus algorithms that have obvious issues. As I write this, the two most popular are PoW (proof of work) and PoS (proof of stake). The former requires absolutely massive computational resources and complexity, and participating in the mining operation is really only limited to huge mining pools and therefore is at the mercy of groups that have the power to create them. Not that equitable. (China problem). Secondly, proof of stake will likely provide mining opportunities to those who have wealth in the system already, so that issue isn’t holistically solved. I understand that there is work to be done, but I just want to know which area is most ripe for myself. Lastly, I don’t see much talk of quantum computing in this world yet, and I’m curious as to how that will effect mining operations and the overall security of the network. Just a thought.</p>
<p>The point of this paper is just to briefly outline some small concerns and areas that I want to engage. Finding ways to do so and take steps in the right direction is a whole separate problem, that will likely only be solved by talking to as many people as possible and learning about what projects are solving which problems. I am still massively overwhelmed by this, but I’m just putting it out there.</p>
<p>Hopefully my intentions and curiosities with this new tech are clear. To make it even more clear, I am fully interested in personal wealth creation, market efficiency, and effective distribution of resources that takes advantage of our most natural proclivities to create an economy where everyone can join to the level that they want, and their are few ceilings on the potential for personal wealth. Uplifting individual creators, working for oneself/generating personal wealth, and meeting basic human needs. These are the things that excite me, and that I think have insane potential in this field. I just don’t know how yet.</p>
